The 'sdist' command obtains the rosie source from github and creates a
source distribution.

The 'bdist_wheel' command builds rosie and creates a binary (wheel)
distribution that can be installed with pip.

Here's how I generate and install the wheel on my OS X machine:

python setup.py sdist
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install dist/rosie-1.0.0b5-cp27-cp27m-macosx_10_13_intel.whl
